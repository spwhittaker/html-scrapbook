<h2>Hello and welcome to my webpage. I hope you like the inconsistent style, the extravagant use of elements, and this saucy Oxford comma.</h2>
<h3>The text is going to keep getting smaller. Don't think it's stopping here.</h3>
<div><p>
What to write about? Well, there's some of my one-off favourite Simpsons characters, I suppose:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hugh Jass. Answered what was meant to be a prank call from Bart, but he was <i>such a great sport</i>! What a guy.</li>
    <li>Handsome Pete. Remember <strong>him</strong>? He wasn't <span style="color:green">Krusty the Klown<sup>or is it 'Krusty the Clown'?</sup></span>, but the friendly guy who would dance for nickels.</li>
    <li>Mr McGreg. <u><i>He</i></u> had a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!</li>
    </ul>
<h4>We're not done with the headings yet.</h4>

    <caption>But how about a table?</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Pastries</th>
            <th>Musical instruments</th>
            <th>Irrational numbers</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Torsade</td>
            <td>Viol</td>
            <td>π</td>

            <td>Euphonium</td>
            <td>√2</td>

<h5>There's another heading.</h5>
    <p style="text-align: center;">It doesn't even have anything of worth to go underneath.</p>
